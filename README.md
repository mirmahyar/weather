A simple React Web app for fetching a Weather API and show the current weather of a chosen city to a user. 
Used Open Weather Map API for this project. 

<<By the way, I tested "React Hooks" capability first time in this project and it was very interesting ! Probably, I will rewrite my other projects with Hooks ! >>

HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT (REACT.JS library)

This is my first JAM stack style web app, which is a philosophy that websites may have No complicated backend part, just JS, API calls, Markup.
